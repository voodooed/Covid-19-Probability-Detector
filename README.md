# Covid-19 Problem

Idea:
1.	The idea is to stop the transmission by prioritizing tests and hence detecting the cases quickly.
2.	Data can be collected on the symptoms of Covid-19.
3.	A machine learning model is then trained on the data to find out the probability of a person having the infection.
4.	The model is then used to find out whom to test under a limited testing capacity.
5.	The same model can be used to find potential candidates for conducting random tests. 

## Machine Learning Model Parameters:

A Team of doctors can sit down to find out best model parameters.
A sample set of parameters is as follows:
1.	Features
•	Average Fever – Continuous
•	Body Pain – 0/1 :- Binary
•	Age – Discrete
•	Runny Nose – 0/1 :- Binary
•	Difficulty in Breathing – Categorical :-  (-1)/0/1 
2.	Labels:
•	Probability of Covid-19 Infection

In this project I have created a Web form in which the Patient will fill the prompted questions based on which it will calculate the Probability of the infection.
